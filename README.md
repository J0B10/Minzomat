# Minzomat
Minzomat makes your server aminzingâ„¢ by adding the following stuff:

1. **Write your own embeds** [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](https://github.com/joblo2213/Minzomat/wiki/write_embeds_en) / [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª](https://github.com/joblo2213/Minzomat/wiki/write_embeds_de)  
   _Allows you to send an embed just like a normal message_

2. **Quote messages**  [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](https://github.com/joblo2213/Minzomat/wiki/quote_messages_en) / [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª](https://github.com/joblo2213/Minzomat/wiki/quote_messages_de)   
   _Allows you to show what another user wrote some time ago inside an embed_  

3. **Large reactions  _[WIP]_**  
   _React on a message with the `:minzomat:` emoji and the bot will display all reactions in one large image._  
   _This Feature is not finished yet._  

_Clicking on the small flags will bring you directly to the wiki pages for that language_
